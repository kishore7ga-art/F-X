/**
 * The four editor themes.
 *
 * ── What this replaces ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Choosing a theme used to run a find-and-replace over every section's stored
 * HTML: a dozen hardcoded hex values, swapped for a dozen others, written back
 * into `sec.code` and autosaved. Three consequences, all of them observed:
 *
 *  1. It was destructive and one-way. `#2563eb` became `#f59e0b`, and switching
 *     back turned *every* `#f59e0b` blue — including the ones the section was
 *     authored with. A tenant who tried two themes could not get their original
 *     colours back, because the information needed to do it had been overwritten.
 *  2. It missed almost everything. Only twelve exact hex strings in four exact
 *     CSS property spellings were matched, so `rgb(37,99,235)`, `#2563EB`,
 *     `background:#2563eb` with no space, and every colour inside a `<style>`
 *     block were left as they were. A "theme switch" recoloured some buttons
 *     and left the page otherwise untouched, which reads as a broken feature.
 *  3. It could not be instant across pages. The rewrite only touched the
 *     sections currently in state — the page being looked at. Other pages kept
 *     the old colours until they were opened and re-themed, so a site could be
 *     half one theme and half another.
 *
 * ── What happens instead ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing is written to `sec.code`, ever. Two mechanisms, both reversible:
 *
 *  1. `themeStylesheet()` emits all four themes' tokens as CSS custom
 *     properties, keyed on a `data-xite-theme` attribute. Switching the theme
 *     sets one attribute on one element. Every section under it retints in the
 *     same frame — no refetch, no re-render of section markup, no reload, and
 *     no dependency on which page happens to be open.
 *  2. `tokenizeSectionCss()` rewrites brand colours to `var(--xite-…, #original)`
 *     *at render time only*. The original hex stays in the file as the
 *     fallback, so a section renders identically with no theme applied, and
 *     removing the theme restores it exactly. This is what lets the tokens
 *     reach colours the old approach could not: it runs over the section's
 *     `<style>` blocks and its inline `style` attributes alike, and it
 *     understands `#rgb`, `#rrggbb` in any case, and `rgb()`/`rgba()`.

 * 0.0198 and was invisible. In the Admin's iframe, which has no theme layer and
 * no tokeniser, the same declaration rendered as written. It is the whole
 * explanation for "the borders disappear in the editor".
 *
 * The fallback is the opaque colour now, so the mix is the only place the alpha
 * is applied. `detokenizeCss` rebuilds the original `rgba()` from the two
 * halves, and the pass only runs when that rebuild is exact — an alpha of
 * `0.125` would come back as `0.13`, so it is left alone rather than rounded.
 *

 * This asked for `wght@400;500;600;700;800;900` — for every family, from one
 * hard-coded list. So 100, 200 and 300 were never downloaded, and any section
 * authored with `font-weight: 300` had no font file to render in. The browser
 * does not report that. It either synthesises a light face by thinning the
 * outlines of the regular one, which looks wrong in a way that is hard to
 * name, or it simply uses the regular weight, so text the author made light
 * came out at normal weight and the setting appeared to do nothing.
 *
 * The ranges come from each font's own entry now, because the two failure
 * modes pull in opposite directions: too narrow and light weights silently
 * vanish, too wide and Google Fonts answers **HTTP 400** — Playfair Display
 * has nothing below 400 — which, since all three families share one URL,
 * would leave every page on the platform with no webfont at all.
 *
 * These are variable fonts, so the wider range costs no extra requests and
 * very little extra weight: it widens the axis inside the same file.

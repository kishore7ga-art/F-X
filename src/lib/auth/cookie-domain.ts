 * render, so the two have to agree on the cookie's `Domain` down to the leading
 * dot. They used to agree only by both reading `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` and
 * hoping an operator had set it in two dashboards. When it was missing the
 * cookie came back scoped to the API's own host, the frontend never saw it, and
 * sign-in returned 200 and left you signed out — with nothing in either log to
 * say so, because from each service's point of view nothing had gone wrong.
 *
 * So it is derived instead. Both services already know the two hostnames
 * involved — the backend from CORS_ORIGINS, the frontend from APP_URL and
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL — and those are not optional: CORS fails loudly
 * without them. Deriving from configuration that is already load-bearing turns
 * a silent misconfiguration into no configuration at all.
 *
 * `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` still wins when set, for a topology this cannot infer.
